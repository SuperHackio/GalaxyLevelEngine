# Galaxy Level Engine
Welcome to the future of Super Mario Galaxy 2 hacking, the Galaxy Level Engine!

## What is it?
The Galaxy Level Engine is a low level engine for making SMG2 mods with. It provides a ton of functionality that you would otherwise not have.

The latest version is GLE-V2 (Released March 31st 2022)

### Primary features
- Up to 8 Power Stars
- Power Stars can be any colour you want
- More control over Star Unlock Conditions
- Make your own Hubworld (World maps no longer exist)

## How do I use it?
For downloads, please visit the [Releases](https://github.com/SuperHackio/GalaxyLevelEngine/releases) page. On that page, you can download:
- The files and Riivolution Memory Patches required to make it work
- An example hack, called the GLE Template Hack, which serves as a demonstration of features, and set of examples.

There is also a [Setup Guide](https://github.com/SuperHackio/GalaxyLevelEngine/wiki/SetupGuide) in the Wiki.<br/>Most things in the GLE are documented on the [Wiki](https://github.com/SuperHackio/GalaxyLevelEngine/wiki), so if you get stuck it is reccomended that you read through it.

## Is it region free?
Starting in GLE-V2, the Galaxy Level Engine has support for NTSC-U, PAL, and NTSC-J.

GLE-V1 is NTSC-U only.

## How can I contribute?
If you would like to suggest a feature, please open a [Feature Request](https://github.com/SuperHackio/GalaxyLevelEngine/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=feature_request.md&title=)

Alternatively, if you discover a bug, experience a Crash, or experience a Freeze, report it by opening a [Bug Report](https://github.com/SuperHackio/GalaxyLevelEngine/issues/new?assignees=SuperHackio&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=)

> *Note: The difference between a Crash and a Freeze is that with a Crash you will have the Crash Debugger appear (it's a black box with a bunch of numbers and text on it). Freezes do not have this, and are often caused when the game cannot find a certain file on the disk or your SD Card.*
