# Scenario Select
The Scenario Select in the Galaxy Level Engine has been updated with new features.

- 8 Power Stars
- 8 "NEW" Bubbles
- 8 Comet bubbles
- 8\* Hidden Star bubbles (see note at bottom of page)

### Power Star positions
Each row in the Scenario Select now has 4 stars each. In the future, you will be able to customize how many stars go in each row (so 6 stars doesn't end up being 4 on top 2 on bottom. See the GLE Template hack's Supermassive Galaxy).

### Bubbles
The Scenario Select now comes equipped with 24 bubbles - 8 "NEW", 8 Comet, and 8\* hidden. (see note at bottom of page)<br/>
This effectively allows you to have multiple stars open at once, and you can control this with the [GalaxyInfo.bcsv](/ScenarioChecking.md).
> *Note: If no power stars appear, please check to make sure that the conditions inside [GalaxyInfo.bcsv](/ScenarioChecking.md) are valid.*

### Power Star Colour
The colours of Power Stars in the Scenario Select automatically are synced with the `PowerStarColor` field in the scenario.

\*7 hidden star bubbles in practice - you can't have 8 hidden stars, so the 8th is just there as crash prevention.
