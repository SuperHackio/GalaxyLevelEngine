# WiiMessageImage
The GLE has a special feature for when you get every single registered star - A Message will be sent to the Wii Message Board.<br/>
Normally, this is just the picture with all the stars in SMG2, but you can customize this to send a custom letter and a custom image.<br/>
Currently, the GLE only supports the use of `AllCompleteImage.bin`.<br/>
The text is inside `LocalizeData/<Language>/MessageData/SystemMessage.arc`, in `WiiMessage.msbt`.

Each image *must* be 512x424 in size.<br/>Once you have a JPEG image, rename it to `AllCompleteImage.bin` and replace the file inside `ObjectData/WiiMessageImage.arc`
